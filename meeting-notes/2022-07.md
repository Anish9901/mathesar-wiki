## Embedded Queries vs Parameterized Queries
- **Summary**: Figure out where the feature boundary between embedded and parameterized queries is and what's actually essential for Cycle 3.
- **Participants:**: Kriti, Sean, Ghislaine, Pavish, Brent, Mukesh, Dhruvi

We're all in agreement about the Record Page, which is a page that shows an individual record's details. There's a section in the page that shows a summary of related records and can allow records shown to be filtered.

The goal of this meeting is to figure out how much of this to implement in Cycle 3, since we have a lot of work to do and we want to do the minimum necessary to get the demo use case working. 

### Product and design concerns
[Record Page](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/design/specs/record-page) design spec so far.

The product goal of embedded queries is to show a summary of related records on a record page. The data shown
should match the links available via Data Explorer UI for consistency.

### Sean's long-term goals for the record page UX
- Let's work from the Patrons record page as an example.
- A section of the Patrons record page displays related records which link to the patron.
- That section contains a list of queries.
- There are two types of queries within the list -- "auto-generated queries" and "manually-generated queries".
- Both types of queries can be re-ordered within the list
- Auto-generated queries:
    - display a table of the related records with all columns.
    - show on the record page by default according to the schema and thus will auto-update when the schema changes
    - should meet user's needs in a majority of circumstances
    - can be hidden via an icon button (and un-hidden via a dropdown menu higher up on the page)
- Manually-generated queries
    - Can be renamed
    - Can be edited
    - Can be deleted
    - Can be created from scratch using the data explorer
- Reactions:
    - Other team members seem mostly in agreement with this UX vision
    - Kriti would like a way to eventually display the related records in a list form (e.g. genres associated with a book). But we'll consider that use-case later.
    - We may eventually want to design functionality for the user to add new related records from within the record page. For example, I may want to record a new checkout for a patron directly on the patron's page. We'll consider that use-case later.

### Backend concerns
- Need to be able to add/remove initial columns according to user desire from a stored query
- Don't really need parameterized queries for the embedded queries. We can filter for the desired id using query string parameters when actually calling the query.
- Links to record:
    - call table endpoint, using filter for appropriate ID

### Decisions
- We recognized that for our needs on the record page, we can handle the "parameterization" of queries using the "filters" functionality that we already have.
- The "auto-generated queries" on the record page will be displayed using our basic records API. No need to create a query resource at all! Just fetch the records and apply a filter to the FK column.
- For cycle 3 we'll only focus on "auto-generated queries". The "manually-generated queries" functionality will be designed/implemented later.
- The output of the auto-generated queries can be further filtered, beyond the auto-added FK filter condition. Any additional filter conditions that the user adds will not persist. But this ad-hoc filtering functionality also gets us a bit closer to the final goal of displaying checked-out books on the Patrons record page -- all without using the data explorer (or Mathesar "queries") at all!

### Next steps
- The "Embedded Queries" feature is now folded into the "Record Page" feature. Because we're not actually using "queries" for the functionality, we may use a name like "Table Widgets" (or similar) to refer to this functionality going forward.
- The "Parameterized Queries" feature is removed entirely as it seems like we may never need it. When the time comes for us to implement "manually-generated queries", we will likely create basic query objects and then filter their results using the filtering functionality when displaying the query (_not_ by altering the query definition).
- Brent is assigned to the Record Page backend since it doesn't involve the Data Explorer anymore. The only thing we need to do is to make the "joinable tables" API work in both directions.
- Kriti will update the storyboard to remove the two features and update the flow according to the new implementation we decided on
